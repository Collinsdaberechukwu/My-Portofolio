    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>I was fassinated by electronics during my childhood,i was addicted to 
        computer and video games since
        childhood.<br>Nevertheless, during my last year in high school, i decide 
        to pusure computer Engineering
        (Software)carrer.<br> probably because i wanted to make computer programs
         expecially games,web sites were both creativities, mathemathics and arts exist,<br><br>
       i had always wanting to become a creator.<br>
       The other Reason was that i always wanted to do things differently and unique 
       from people around me,<br>during those times in high school none of my friends wanted to follow my software path
       and it was not a popular chioce in my area as of that time,<br>
       I have no regret so far.
